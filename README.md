## Introduction

This project bridges the gap between NASA’s PACE mission satellite data and educational resources. We aim to make oceanic and atmospheric data accessible and engaging for students of all age groups. Through interactive tools and lessons, we foster curiosity and encourage a deeper understanding of ocean literacy.

---

## Challenge: PACE In The Classroom

We are participating in the **Pace in the Classroom** challenge, which focuses on transforming complex data from NASA’s PACE satellite into engaging and digestible educational content for students worldwide.

### Challenge Overview

The **Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite** was launched on **February 8, 2024**, and has been gathering critical data about Earth’s oceans and atmosphere. This data, made publicly available by NASA, is often too technical for students and non-experts to grasp.

Our goal is to bridge this gap by developing engaging, kid-friendly educational materials that turn PACE’s scientific data into lessons for classrooms worldwide, promoting ocean literacy and inspiring curiosity.

### Summary

NASA’s PACE satellite collects essential data on Earth’s atmosphere and oceans, helping scientists understand phytoplankton and ocean-atmosphere interactions. However, the complexity of this data presents a barrier for students. 

Our project aims to convert this intricate data into interactive, engaging content that teachers can integrate into their curriculums, improving ocean literacy and inspiring the next generation to explore Earth sciences.

## Impact

With our interactive, easy-to-use tools, we aim to:

- **Increase ocean literacy** among students globally.
- **Inspire curiosity** about Earth sciences and climate change.
- **Empower students** to explore real-time satellite data in a fun and approachable way.

## Application

### Home Page:

- Interaction with a 3D Earth globe: The Home Page serves as the interactive centerpiece of the project, allowing users to engage with a fully rotatable 3D globe. This immersive feature gives users the ability to explore different parts of the Earth, observe various regions of the ocean and atmosphere, and develop a visual connection to the data. The globe displays real-time environmental information, introducing users to global ecosystems, and providing a contextual understanding of the Earth’s climate systems. This page also sets the stage for deeper learning in subsequent sections.

  ![Home Page (3)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0198700-5575-4e7a-a408-f732bdcc732f)

### Explore Page:

- Learn about PACE’s instruments: On the Explore Page, users can delve into the science behind the instruments aboard NASA's PACE satellite. Detailed explanations of the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI), SPEXone polarimeter, and HARP2 polarimeter are paired with interactive visuals. This page is designed to make complex satellite instruments more approachable, explaining how they collect crucial data on ocean color, aerosol properties, and atmospheric particles. Each instrument plays a key role in monitoring Earth's climate, and this page provides a digestible, student-friendly introduction to their functions.
  - Interactive instrument learning: By clicking on the icons or images of the instruments, users are presented with animated descriptions, showing how each one operates in space and collects data. This hands-on experience helps users, particularly students, visualize what these sophisticated devices do in the context of Earth sciences.

### Lessons Page:

- Explore lessons on PACE and Earth systems: The Lessons Page is a cornerstone of the educational aspect of this project. It offers structured, interactive lessons for students of various age groups. These lessons cover topics like the science behind PACE’s mission, how its instruments work, and the importance of studying Earth’s oceans and atmosphere. By engaging students with visual explanations, videos, and quizzes, this page encourages active learning and makes complex scientific concepts more accessible.
  
  - Learning modules: Each lesson module is carefully crafted to provide a mix of theory and interactive activities. Students can explore how phytoplankton impacts ocean health, or how aerosols affect the atmosphere, by interacting with on-screen simulations and images. This makes it easier to understand how the data PACE gathers translates into real-world impacts on the environment.
    
  - Self-paced quizzes: After each lesson, students are encouraged to take quizzes to test their understanding. This reinforces learning and makes it more engaging for young minds.

### Maps Page:

- Visualize global data on Chlorophyll, Carbon, and Sea Surface Temperature: The Maps Page offers two distinct visualization tools to help users understand critical environmental data gathered by NASA's PACE satellite. It includes an interactive 3D Earth globe for spatial exploration and Graph Visualization for detailed temporal data analysis.

  - 3D Earth Globe: Users can interact with a fully rotatable 3D globe that displays real-time data for Chlorophyll concentrations, Carbon levels, and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). The 3D view allows users to explore global patterns and observe how ocean and atmospheric conditions vary across different regions of the planet. This visualization helps students and teachers connect large-scale environmental processes with specific geographic locations.
    
  - Graph Visualization: In addition to the 3D globe, the Maps Page also features a Graph Visualization tool that plots the mean values of environmental data, such as Chlorophyll and Carbon concentrations and Sea Surface temperature, over a 30-day period. The graphs display key trends and fluctuations in these metrics, helping users understand how environmental factors change over time. This feature allows students and educators to analyze temporal trends in ocean and atmospheric data.

  - Data insights: The combination of the 3D Earth globe and Graph Visualization offers users a comprehensive understanding of how PACE data translates into real-world impacts. While the 3D globe provides a global overview of Earth's climate and ecosystems, the graphs give a time-based perspective, enabling deeper insights into trends and variations over monthly periods.
